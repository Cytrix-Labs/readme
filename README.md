## What we do

- **Advanced Threat Intelligence** — CTI pipelines, enrichment, and MENA-focused blocklists.
- **Offensive Security** — Red teaming, penetration testing, adversary simulation, and continuous attack surface management.
- **Cloud & Platform Security** — Zero-trust architecture, IaC security, K8s hardening, secretless CI/CD.
- **Secure Infrastructure** — Hardened images, endpoint baselines, network segmentation, and HSM-backed key management.
- **AI/LLM Engineering** — Domain-tuned LLMs, private RAG, safety/guardrails, evaluation & benchmarking.
- **Automation at Scale** — SOAR workflows, detections engineering, and closed-loop remediation.
